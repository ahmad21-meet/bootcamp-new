    <> Since March 8, 1990, Womanâ€™s Day is being observed by/<strong> SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) consisting of seven countries,</strong>
         namely, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, <em>Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. The day was marked to focus on the problems of girl children </em> in these countries. 
         <br>
         <br>

         It is a pity that girl children especially in underdeveloped countries are victims of extreme negligence and dishonour.
          The<b> birth of a girl child is looked upon by the parents as a cause of pity.</b>
